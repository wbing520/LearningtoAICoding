## Sample Lesson: Building Your First AI Model

### Objective
Create a simple machine learning model that can predict whether a student will pass or fail based on hours studied and previous grades.

### Materials Needed
- Computer with Python installed
- scikit-learn library
- matplotlib and pandas libraries
- Sample dataset (provided)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Import necessary libraries**
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
   ```

2. **Create a sample dataset**
   ```python
   # Create sample data (hours studied, previous grade, pass/fail)
   data = {
       'hours_studied': [1, 2, 2.5, 4, 5, 3.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1.5, 3],
       'previous_grade': [65, 70, 60, 75, 80, 73, 85, 90, 92, 95, 55, 69],
       'passed': [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  # 0=fail, 1=pass
   }
   
   df = pd.DataFrame(data)
   ```

3. **Visualize the data**
   ```python
   # Plot the data to see patterns
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
   plt.scatter(df['hours_studied'], df['previous_grade'], 
              c=df['passed'], cmap='winter')
   plt.colorbar(label='Passed (1) / Failed (0)')
   plt.xlabel('Hours Studied')
   plt.ylabel('Previous Grade')
   plt.title('Student Performance Data')
   plt.show()
   ```

4. **Prepare data for training**
   ```python
   # Split features and target
   X = df[['hours_studied', 'previous_grade']]
   y = df['passed']
   
   # Split into training and testing sets
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
   ```

5. **Create and train the model**
   ```python
   # Create a logistic regression model (good for binary classification)
   model = LogisticRegression()
   
   # Train the model
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

6. **Test the model**
   ```python
   # Make predictions
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   
   # Check accuracy
   accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
   print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
   ```

7. **Use the model to make predictions**
   ```python
   # Function to predict if a student will pass
   def predict_pass(hours, grade):
       result = model.predict([[hours, grade]])[0]
       if result == 1:
           return "Pass"
       else:
           return "Fail"
   
   # Test with new data
   new_student1 = [8, 85]  # hours studied, previous grade
   new_student2 = [2, 65]  # hours studied, previous grade
   
   print(f"Student 1 prediction: {predict_pass(new_student1[0], new_student1[1])}")
   print(f"Student 2 prediction: {predict_pass(new_student2[0], new_student2[1])}")
   ```

8. **Visualize the decision boundary**
   ```python
   # Function to plot decision boundary
   def plot_decision_boundary(X, y, model):
       # Set min and max values with some padding
       x_min, x_max = X['hours_studied'].min() - 1, X['hours_studied'].max() + 1
       y_min, y_max = X['previous_grade'].min() - 1, X['previous_grade'].max() + 1
       
       # Create a mesh grid
       xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.arange(x_min, x_max, 0.1),
                           np.arange(y_min, y_max, 0.1))
       
       # Predict for each point in the mesh
       Z = model.predict(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()])
       Z = Z.reshape(xx.shape)
       
       # Plot the contour and training examples
       plt.contourf(xx, yy, Z, alpha=0.3, cmap='winter')
       plt.scatter(X['hours_studied'], X['previous_grade'], c=y, cmap='winter', edgecolors='k')
       plt.xlabel('Hours Studied')
       plt.ylabel('Previous Grade')
       plt.title('Student Pass/Fail Decision Boundary')
       plt.colorbar(label='Passed (1) / Failed (0)')
       plt.show()
   
   # Plot the decision boundary
   plot_decision_boundary(df[['hours_studied', 'previous_grade']], df['passed'], model)
   ```

### Explanation
